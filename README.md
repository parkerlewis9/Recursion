# Recursion

Recursion is doing the same thing over again. Recursion, is doing the same thing over again. In some cases it is repeating the same action of a mathematical formula. However it is much more than that. It can enable you to travese down a tree by returning values through a Call Stack. You can iterate through data from an AJAX call to create repeated web components. Regardless of the application, thinking of yourself as the thing that is recursing can help - the state at each call stack frame. You are the function and you need information to complete the task that you have. We will make use of this frame of thinking to discuss a few applications of recursion. 

This repo consists of modules which contain a skeleton of a function and test cases for that function. Implement the functions using the guidance in the accompaning README.md file. 

1) Iterative type problem - factorial

2) Boolean return - isaPalindrome

3) callback iterative - map

4) accumulating - filter

This is all on linear data structures ^^^
This is on trees (and graphs?) vvv

5) In Order Depth First Search to Retrieve All Values

6) Sorting??

Note: The test command for all modules is npm test. All dependencies are loaded for you.
