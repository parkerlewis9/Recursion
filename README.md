# Recursion

Recursion is doing the same thing over again. Recursion, is doing the same thing over again. In some cases it is repeating the same action of a mathematical formula. However it is much more than that. It can enable you to travese down a tree by returning values through a call stack. You can iterate through data from an AJAX call to create repeated web components. Regardless of the application, thinking of yourself as the thing that is recursing can help - the state at each call stack frame. You are the function and you need information to complete the task that you have. You are always asking the yourself the question, "What do I want to return?" We will make use of this frame of thinking to discuss a few applications of recursion. 

This repo consists of modules corresponding to different archetypes of recursive algorithms. Each contains an explanation of the type of recursion to be implemented. The skeleton of a function and test cases for that function are provided for you to practice the topics discussed. Running `npm test` in each module will run the code in the file corresponding to the name of the directory. 


1) [Mathmatical Recursion](./m1_Mathematical_factorial)

2) Boolean return - isaPalindrome

3) callback iterative - map

4) accumulating - filter

This is all on linear data structures ^^^
This is on trees (and graphs?) vvv

5) In Order Depth First Search to Retrieve All Values

6) Sorting??

Note: The test command for all modules is npm test. All dependencies are loaded for you.

Note the project is setup to install and run these utilities via npm scripts. 

Learning how to recurse first, then we can cover edge cases and added functionality. (repeated from accumulating)
